Humans spend a lot of time searching for things. 
With the advent of tools like google maps and open street maps, people can search through geospatial data at a whim. 
These tools focus on providing exact matches to queries or a list of candidate locations based on the user's query. 
Frequently, searchers only have access to partial information. 
Whether it has been a long time since visiting a location, they have a vague recommendation from a friend or are an investigator trying to identify a location to solve a crime- a common problem is how to find a location of interest based on partial information. 
This project designs \textit{the \textbf{G}eospatially \textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{S}earch with \textbf{T}errain \textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{L}ocation \textbf{T}argeting (\textbf{GESTALT})}, and implements a proof-of-concept of the proposed architecture. 
Based on a new best-case dataset developed for this project, \textit{The Swan Valley Wineries dataset}, demonstrates the functionality and utility of \textit{GESTALT} while identifying substantial opportunities for future work.
