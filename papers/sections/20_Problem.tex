\section{Problem Definition}
\label{section:problem}

Describe the problem here......

\subsection{Preliminaries}
\textbf{Define region, location, object.....}
\emph{Objects} are any physical entity. For example, a \textit{tree, building, lake, bridge, gate} or \textit{sign} could be objects. \textit{Objects} can also have attributes that provide amplifying information about the object, including things like \textit{color, material, size, species etc.}. 

\emph{Locations} are physical entities that \textit{do} something. They are the meaningful grouping of objects determined by ownership, proximity or utility. They have some purpose other than being an object. They could be a \textit{business, attraction, property etc.}. 

\textbf{Define last-mile search, object ownership task, concept mapping, progressive search.....}


%\subsection{Data Sources}
%Before delving into what data is needed, quickly reviewing the available data sources will highlight opportunities. 
%\subsubsection{Google Maps}
%Google Maps\footnote{\href{https://www.google.com/maps/about/}{Google Maps}} is a suite of applications maintained by Google for users to \textit{"explore and navigate} [their] \textit{world"}. 
%While it is open for community contributions of locations, it is a commercial platform that charges for API access\footnote{\href{https://mapsplatform.google.com/pricing/}{Pricing for Google Maps API}}. 
%In addition to coordinating information, Google Maps contains Street View imagery, user reviews, and user-submitted pictures. 
%Google Maps does not record \textit{objects} unless they are monuments or landmarks of significance.

%\subsection{Automation}
%Automating the labeling process is essential to scaling \textit{GESTALT} beyond a trivial size. 
%Options for automation are explored in detail in sections \ref{section:architecture} and \ref{section:related}, but essentially rely on combining remote sensing imagery, ground-based imagery and image metadata to generate mappings of objects to coordinates and parent locations.
%The ability to autonomously determine object locations will set the conditions for the remaining elements of GESTALT to scale.
